    "# Guessing Game - Problem 406\n",
    "\n",
    "We are trying to find a hidden number selected from the set of integers $\\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$ by asking questions.  \n",
    "Each number (question) we ask, we get one of three possible answers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"Your guess is lower than the hidden number\" (and you incur a cost of $a$), or  \n",
    "- \"Your guess is higher than the hidden number\" (and you incur a cost of $b$), or  \n",
    "- \"Yes, that's it!\" (and the game ends).\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the value of $n$, $a$, and $b$, an **optimal strategy** minimizes the total cost *for the worst possible case*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If $n = 5$, $a = 2$, and $b = 3$, then we may begin by asking **2** as our first question.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If we are told that 2 is higher than the hidden number (for a cost of $b = 3$), then we are sure that **1** is the hidden number (for a total cost of **3**).  \n",
    "- If we are told that 2 is lower than the hidden number (for a cost of $a = 2$), then our next question will be **4**.  \n",
    "- If we are told that 4 is higher than the hidden number (for a cost of $b = 3$), then we are sure that **3** is the hidden number (for a total cost of $2 + 3 = \\mathbf{5}$).  \n",
    "- If we are told that 4 is lower than the hidden number (for a cost of $a = 2$), then we are sure that **5** is the hidden number (for a total cost of $2 + 2 = \\mathbf{4}$).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the worst-case cost achieved by this strategy is **5**.  \n",
    "It can also be shown that this is the lowest worst-case cost that can be achieved.  \n",
    "So, in fact, we have just described an optimal strategy for the given values of $n$, $a$, and $b$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $C(n, a, b)$ be the worst-case cost achieved by an optimal strategy for the given values of $n$, $a$, and $b$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "C(5, 2, 3) &= 5 \\\\\n",
    "C(500, \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}) &= 13.22073197\\dots \\\\\n",
    "C(20000, 5, 7) &= 82 \\\\\n",
    "C(2000000, \\sqrt{5}, \\sqrt{7}) &= 49.63755955\\dots\n",
